# iCal4j Template

iCal4j Template provides prototypes for common iCalendar and vCard use-cases.

## Overview

Whilst the iCalendar and vCard specifications provide generalized component and property constraints, some applications
may require further constraints to fulfill the requirements of the use-case. iCal4j Templates provides some
opinionated prototyping and validation for common use-cases, and a portable definition language for constructing
your own.

## Usage

TBD.

## Semantic Calendaring
