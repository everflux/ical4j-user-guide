# iCal4j Template - Agile

Templates for working with Agile methodologies.

## Overview

[Agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) is a software development methodology that prioritises 
collaboration between developers and users and responding rapidly to changing requirements. Agile
is also successfully applied more generally as a project management methodology.

## Sprint

A key aspect of many Agile implementations is to work in timeboxed iterations, often called sprints. Here we
provide a Sprint template to represent a single iteration that has an associated backlog of work items planned for the
iteration.

## Backlog

A Backlog represents a group of work items that may be associated with zero or more Sprints.

## Story

A Story represents a single work item that can be implemented and tested independently of others. Typically, each
Story will have its own acceptance criteria to define what a working implementation looks like.

## Epic

An Epic is used to group work items that combine to provide a larger feature. These features are typically
demonstrable in ceremonies such as showcases.

## Criteria

A Criteria represents a set of customer requirements that are used to guide the defined work items. Also known
as a User Story, Criteria document the WHAT, whereas work items such as Epics and Stories capture the HOW.

## Retrospective

A Retrospective is a special kind of [Meeting](groupware.md#meeting) [Agenda](groupware.md#agenda) that aims to
reflect on current progress and practices to identify what works and what doesn't. As with a regular Agenda, any
points not discussed may be carried over to the next Retrospective Meeting.
