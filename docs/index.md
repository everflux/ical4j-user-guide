# Introduction

The iCal4j project is a collection of Open Source Java libraries providing support for the iCalendar
specifications (RFCs).

The core iCal4j library provides an implementation of the iCalendar [specifications](https://www.ical4j.org/rfcs/) that
are designed to facilitate interoperability between calendaring and scheduling software systems.

iCalendar provides a common data format used to store scheduling information such as events, appointments, to-do lists, etc. All of the popular calendaring tools, such as Lotus Notes, Outlook and Apple's iCal also support the iCalendar standard.
