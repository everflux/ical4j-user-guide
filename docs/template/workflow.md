# iCal4j Template - Workflow

Workflow-related templates.

## Overview

A workflow may represent a sequence of steps that define a process, often useful for collaborative activities
between teams and individuals.

## Workspace

A Workspace represents an area where one or more teams and/or individuals collaborate in order to service workflow
requests. A Workspace is different to a [Project](project.md#project) in that it does not have specific
[Objectives](project.md#objective), but rather exists solely for the service of requests.

## Request

A Request represents a demand for service or feature provided by the Workspace. Requests are typically created by
teams or individual external to the Workspace, and serviced by those within. There may be one or more Tasks
associated in order to fulfill the Request.

## Approval

An Approval may be required as part of a workflow in order to review or assess the validity of a Request or Tasks
associated with it. An Approval may also be used to trigger the creation of additional Tasks required for
service fulfilment.

## Roster

A Roster represents the availability of teams or individuals for servicing requests. A Roster may be used to identify
who should be notified in the event of a new Request.
