iCal4j Template provides support for rendering iCalendar (and vCard) objects to other formats.

## Overview

Rendering iCalendar and vCard data in UIs is a necessary feature of most calendaring applications, and this library provides
templates to assist. Templates for individual properties or componenents may be combined to produce rendered views in various
formats that may be used to represent objects.

## Usage

iCal4j Template provides helpers for rendering data with [Handlebars](http://jknack.github.io/handlebars.java/),
which may be useful rendering objects in HTML or other formats.
