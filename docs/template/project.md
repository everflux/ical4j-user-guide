# iCal4j Template - Project

Project management templates.

## Overview

Project management focuses on the collaboration between individuals and teams to achieve specific outcomes. A project
may represent a time-bounded or unbounded collaboration, and is the focal point for tracking objectives, risk,
issues, etc. associated with the collaborative activities.

## Team

A Team is a group of individual members, working together to achieve common collaborative outcomes. Teams may be
hierarchical in that a Team can be a member of another Team.

## Project

A Project is represented as collaborative activity associated with one or more teams and/or individuals. Each Project 
may have associated objectives, risks, issues, etc. that are used to guide collaborative activities.

## Objective

An Objective identifies a specific goal of a project, and may be used to group specific risks, issues and milestones.
Objectives should be high-level, and focus on the WHY aspects of a Project (i.e. what is the purpose of the project).

## Milestone

A Milestone represents a target within a project that may be associated with a specific Objective. The Milestone
defines the WHAT aspect of Project activities and are an opportunity to track progress within a Project.

## Task

A Task captures a specific activity undertaken by a team or individual. Each Task may be associated with a Milestone
such that progress towards Milestone completion may be accurately tracked.

## Risk

A Risk is used to track potential problems or issues associated with a Project. Essentially a Risk is an unrealised
issue, which has an associated likelihood and impact to a Project.

## Issue

Issues are challenges and blockers to Project Tasks. Resolution of an Issue may require additional Tasks to be
completed first.

## Decision

A Decision captures agreement on a critical Project element that may be referred to or superseded at a later date.
Decisions are Project assumptions that ensure collaborators all agree on Project outcomes and deliverables.
