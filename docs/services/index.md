# iCal4j Services

A collection of iCalendar functions delivered as HTTP services.

## Overview

iCal4j services is a collection of libraries that support deployment as a service. For example:

* [iCal4j Validator]
* [iCal4j Serializer]
* [iCal4j FreeBusy]
* [iCal4j Connector]
* [iCal4j Integration]
* [iCal4j Query]
* [iCal4j User Agent]
* ...

Each of these libraries are bundled with an HTTP Servlet and may be deployed either in a Web container or
standalone with an embedded Jetty server. They are stateless services and containerisation will be supported
to provide maximum choice in how they are deployed.

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate how you might use iCal4j services to enhance an application or service.

### Validate (and sanitise) incoming iCalendar data

The issue of calendar spam and other embedded nasties is becoming more of a concern for iCalendar data. The [iCal4j
Validator] can potentially be used to screen incoming data not only for RFC compliance but also against unwanted
or blacklisted content.

### Generate Atom feeds from published iCalendar data

Using the [iCal4j Serializer] you can easily transform iCalendar data to Atom feed data, including expansion of
recurring events.

### Publish free/busy information for published iCalendar data

You may have a need for the [iCal4j FreeBusy] service to generate free/busy data from resource calendars to assist 
with scheduling.

### Query iCalendar data using filter expressions

iCal4j includes support for a filter expression language that may be used to extract information from iCalendar
object data using the [iCal4j Query] service.

### Process iCalendar iTIP for scheduling

The iTIP specification defines how to coordinate iCalendar data between multiple calendar user agents (CUAs), and
the [iCal4j User Agent] simplifies the processing of this data.

### Send and receive iCalendar data asynchronously

TBD.

### Manage iCalendar data with CalDAV

TBD.
