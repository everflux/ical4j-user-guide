# iCal4j Template - Catalog

Templates for managing a product or service catalog.

## Overview

A catalog is a common approach to providing products or services to customers. A catalog can be useful where you
have a standard offering that is provisioned/fulfilled on a request basis. Orders can be placed by selecting
Offers from the catalog, which are then fulfilled as part of a Workflow.

## Offer

An Offer is a time-bounded catalog item that represents an available product or service offering. An Offer may also be
a combination of other product/service offerings.

## Order

An Order is similar to a Request, but it is a request for one or more standard offerings, or Offers.


## Fulfilment

A Fulfilment is similar to a Task in that it represents some work to be performed, but is specifically constrained to
the provisioning or fulfilment of an Order.
