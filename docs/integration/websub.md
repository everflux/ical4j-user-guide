# iCal4j Integration - Websub

Websub is a W3C standard for a publish/subscribe pattern online. Subscription is managed via an intermediary Hub,
such that when a publisher sends updates to the Hub it is redistributed to subscribers.

iCal4j supports publishing content to a Websub Hub, as well as support for a subscriber callback (i.e. a webhook)
for consuming Hub content.
